Thus, the development of P2B001 is intended to provide a combination of low doses of these two drugs, in an improved formulation, that is hoped to be more effective in controlling Parkinson's disease symptoms and with less side effects than each of the drugs taken alone or the current available commercial drugs taken together.

The feasibility of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) to utilize to feedback to modulate and improve their gait and posture will be investigated. Two types of feedback will be studied: (a) continuous feedback involving sonification of movements to facilitate learning proper movements (such as to take big steps, swing arms, rhythmic walking, maintain upright posture, etc.) and (b) on-demand feedback where the feedback is provided only if necessary to reduce overload of information and prevent developing dependency on the system.",Not Applicable,2019-05-10,2020-06-03,2021-06-30,Not yet recruiting,,,,"Progressive gait dysfunction is one of the main motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). It is generally expressed as reduced step length and gait speed, and as increased variability in step time and length. People with PD also exhibit stooped posture, which besides apparent disfigurement, also disrupts gait. The gait and posture impairments are usually resistant to the pharmacological treatment, worsen as the disease progresses, increase the likelihood of falls, and result in higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. These impairments may be caused by perceptual (spatial awareness) difficulties due to deficiency in processing information related to movement initiation and execution, which can result in misperceptions of the actual effort required to perform a desired movement and posture. Due to this, people with PD often depend on external cues during motor tasks.||Although numerous studies have shown that cues can improve gait in PD, they did not provide feedback of the performance in real-time which is crucial to perceive, modulate, and achieve the desired movements. There are a few studies that provided real-time feedback using treadmill-based systems and observed improvements in gait in PD, however, they are not suitable for practicing target movements conveniently during free-living conditions, which can strongly reinforce movement patterns and improve clinical outcomes. There has been very little investigations of wearable real-time feedback (WRTF) systems to improve gait and posture in PD. The investigators are aware of only one study that tried to improve gait using a wearable system with real-time feedback capabilities, but the study did not provide any feedback on posture. Also, some of the parameters used for feedback were not easy to perceive and modulate in real-time.||Based on the investigators' recent success with a treadmill-based real-time feedback system which improved gait and posture in people with PD, the proposed study will develop a WRTF system, validate its performance with gold standard measures from a motion capture system, and test its feasibility in a group of people with mild to moderate PD. The most novel aspects of the proposed system are that it will provide feedback on parameters such as step length, arm swing, step time, and upright posture which have been greatly affected in PD and shown to increase the risk factors for balance disorders and falls. In addition, the system will consists of two types of feedback: a Continuous Feedback (CF) mode and an On-Demand Feedback (ODF) mode. The CF mode will help users learn and practice desired gait and posture movements and the ODF mode will help to maintain them during activities of daily living.

MoCA is composed of eight cognitive domains, which are scored within a range of 0 to 30 points (higher scores indicate better function): short-term memory; visuospatial skills; executive function; verbal fluency; attention, concentration and working memory; language; sentence repetition; and spatiotemporal orientation.","Baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 10 weeks (follow-up)|Baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 10 weeks (follow-up)",Changes in attention and mental flexibility assessed by the Trail Making Test - A and B|Changes in executive functions and planning assessed by the London Tower Task|Changes in working memory assessed by the Digit Span Forward and Backward Test|Changes in balance assessed by the Mini-BESTest|Changes in gait speed assessed by 10 Meter Walk Test|Changes in quality of life for people with Parkinson's disease assessed by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39),"To assess this outcome, the Trail Making Test - Parts A and B will be used. In condition A, the participant must draw lines, without removing the pencil from the paper, to connect numbers in a sequence. In condition B, the participant must draw lines to connect numbers and letters in an alternating numeric and alphabetic sequence. Prior to the execution of the task, a short ""training sheet"" is presented from both parts, in which the above instructions are given. The final score represents the total time to finish the task execution. When the participant makes a mistake during the test, the examiner should point out the error at the time of the test and ask the examiner to return to the previous circle and continue the test. Thus, errors are not logged, but result in an increase in total time.|The Tower of London task is very sensitive to evaluate executive dysfunction in PD patients. The Tower of London is made up of three vertical pins of different heights and three colored spheres, with a hole in the center for the pins to fit. The goal is to move them to reproduce, in a given number of moves, the position of a presented target figure. There are 15 problems with increasing difficulty and reduced possibilities for moving parts. Three attempts to resolve the issue are allowed. Will be evaluated: total and average execution time, and total score, obtained by the sum of the points of each step, ranging from 0 to 3.|The Digit Span Forward (DSF) is related to the efficiency of attention, while the Digit Span Backward (DSB), the performance of working memory. Both tests involve six pairs of random numeric sequences that the examiner reads aloud at the rate of one per second. During the DSF the participant will have to repeat each sequence of numbers exactly as they were given, while in the DSB they have to repeat each sequence of numbers in the reverse order. When a sequence is repeated correctly, the examiner reads the next one continuing until the subject fails in a set of sequences or repeats the highest sequence correctly. For each digit repeated correctly, one point is given.|The Mini-BESTest test will be used to evaluate static and dynamic balance in 14 activities. These include TUG (Timed Up and Go), Push and Release Test and gait quality while changing speed, handling obstacles and turning on your own body axis. Each of the 14 items is scored from 0 to 2, with 0 indicating the lowest level of functionality.|To evaluate gait speed and cadence will be used the 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT). A distance of 10 meters will be determined, with 2 meters of initial acceleration and 2 meters for deceleration. Participants will have 3 attempts to travel the distance, walking as fast as possible without running. An average of the time spent during the three attempts will be calculated. Finally, the number of steps will be counted by visual observation.|PDQ-39 is a specific quality of life assessment scale for Parkinson's disease and comprises 39 items that can be answered with five different response options: ""never""; ""Sometimes""; ""sometimes""; ""often""; ""Always"" or ""it's impossible for me"". The instrument is divided into eight dimensions: Mobility (10 items), Daily Living Activities (6 items), Emotional Wellbeing (6 items), Stigma (4 items), Social Support (3 items), Cognition (4 items) , Communication (3 items) and Body Discomfort (3 items). The total score for each individual is calculated according to the following formula: 100 x (sum of patient scores on 39 questions / 4 x 39). The score of each dimension is obtained in the same way as the total score. A low score indicates better perception of quality of life by the individual.","Baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 10 weeks (follow-up)|Baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 10 weeks (follow-up)|Baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 10 weeks (follow-up)|Baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 10 weeks (follow-up)|Baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 10 weeks (follow-up)|Baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 10 weeks (follow-up)",,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of idiopathic PD, issued by a neurologist specializing in movement disorders;|Disease staging between I and III, according to the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale;|Be using antiparkinsonian medication regularly;|Score higher than 24 or 18 (for participants with low education), verified through the Mini Mental State Examination.||Exclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of atypical parkinsonism;|Neurological comorbidities;|History of epilepsy, neurosurgery (including metal clip implantation) and pacemaker implantation;|Previous surgical intervention for PD (DBS implantation - deep brain stimulation);|Presence of severe freezing episodes.",,No,,João Pessoa,PB,Suellen Marinho Andrade

Several studies have shown that motor symptoms occur when at least 50 % of dopaminergic neurons are lost. However, there are evidence suggesting that the level of dopaminergic denervation is not homogenous at the time of diagnosis.||Some patients have a higher level of dopaminergic loss at disease onset indicating the existence of compensation mechanisms. The aim of this study is to decipher how the metabolism of dopamine is involved in this compensation with a focus on the polymorphism of the COMT gene. This gene is expressed according to two variant: (i) COMT H that encodes a form of the enzyme with a high level of activity and (ii) COMT L that encode a form of the enzyme with a low level of activity. Thus, there are 3 possible genotypes in the population: (i) COMT HH associated with an increased degradation of dopamine, (ii) COMT LL associated with a decreased degradation of dopamine and (iii) COMT HH (intermediary between COMT HH and COMT LL).||The hypothesis is that this polymorphism of the COMT gene may participate to compensation mechanisms in early PD. Patients with COMT HH genotype may have an earlier motor symptoms onset than patients with COMT LL genotype.||To test this hypothesis, we will recruit 51 patients with de novo PD will be recruited (17 patients for each genotype). Given the distribution of COMT polymorphism in the population, a maximum sample of 76 patients will be screened to recruit 17 patients for each genotype.||Clinical evaluation will include MDS-UPDRS, Non Motor Symptoms Scale, segmental symptoms scale, Montreal Cognitive assessment, MMSE, Frontal assessment battery and Parkinson's disease behavioral assessment scale (ECMP). All the patients will have a monophotonic emission tomography with I-123-Ioflupane in order to assess the level of dopaminergic denervation and an MRI scan with resting state study. Cerebrospinal fluid sampling will be optional and will allow direct measurements of dopamine metabolites.||The main outcome measure will be the level of dopaminergic denervation on I-123-Ioflupane scans according to COMT genotype, age, gender and severity of motor symptoms on the MDS-UPDRS part 3.||If this hypothesis is confirmed, this will allow to test the efficacy of COMT inhibitors in order to delay dopaminergic drugs initiation for PD patients.",,,,"Comparison of the degree of presynaptic dopaminergic denervation across the 3 genotypes group (COMT HH, COMT HL and COMT LL) at the time of diagnostic of Parkinson disease",The degree of presynaptic dopaminergic denervation estimated by the potential links of 123I-FP-CIT (radioligand dopamine transporter) on scintigraphy images of single photon emission,Within 3 months after inclusion,"Degree of presynaptic denervation in three groups: COMT HH, COMT LL, COMT HL with and without adjustment for age, sex and UPDRS III score|CSF dopamine metabolite levels at the time of diagnosis (CSF sampling will be optional) in the groups COMT HH, COMT HL and COMT LL|Functional connectivity resting MRI Index obtained by full integration and graph theory based on genotypes (COMT HH, COMT LL, COMT HL) and denervation degree (MPET).|MDS UPDRS-III motor score according to the genotypes (COMT HH, COMT LL, COMT HL) and denervation degree observed by MPET",,Within 3 months after inclusion|Within 3 months after inclusion|Within 3 months after inclusion|Within 3 months after inclusion,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Man or woman ≥ 18 years old,|Caucasian origin|Parkinson's disease considered to be probable as defined by the criteria of UK Parkinson's disease Brain Bank (Hugues and coll 2002)|Absence of anti-parkinsonian medication|Patient affilied to a social security system|Signed information consent form||Exclusion Criteria:||Parkinsonian syndrome secondary to neuroleptics|Atypical parkinsonian syndrome such a multisystem atrophy, progressive supranuclear paralysis, dementia with levy bodies.|MRI contraindication (claustrophobia, not compatible mechanical heart valve MRI, pacemaker, cochlear implant, other body ferromagnetic objects, pregnancy) - MPET contraindication (pregnancy, feeding, hypersensitivity to ioflupane [123]|Patient under guardianship or trusteeship|Any other significant pathology that could prevent patient participation and achievement of planned examinations (except for lumbar puncture)|Patient participating or having participated in other biomedical research involving a drug in the three months prior to inclusion|Specific exclusion criteria if lumbar puncture is accepted by the patient: Anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment; history of hemostasis disorders; platelets <150,000 mm3; TP <80%; TCA (patient / control)> 1.2.|Hypersensitivity to local anesthetics with amide link or to any of the excipients",,No,,Paris,,Groupe Hospitalier Pitié-Salpêtrière

In this sense, therapies capable of minimizing this impact are extremely important. Osteopathy has become an alternative treatment for individuals with neurological disorders and has been shown to be effective in treating various conditions, including PD. Objective: a) to evaluate the acute effect of visceral manipulation directed to the intestines and visceral plexuses in the autonomic nervous system of PD patients; b) identify the effect of this approach, after four visits, on balance, plantar pressure, gastrointestinal disorders and autonomic nervous system in this population. Materials and Methods: For this randomized clinical trial, 28 adults diagnosed with PD will be recruited. Subjects will be randomized to protocols in two groups: intervention protocol and placebo protocol, where both will consist of 4 visits twice a week. The intervention protocol will consist of osteopathic manipulative techniques and the sham protocol will consist of simulation of therapy, where the therapist will place his hands in the same regions of the intervention protocol, with superficial contact and without therapeutic intention in each region. The outcome measures of the study will consist of Berg balance assessment and plantar pressure, Rome survey on gastrointestinal disorders, and assessment of autonomic modulation by means of heart rate variability analysis.

737,NCT04354298,Parkinson Disease,Effects of Improvisational Dance on Cognition and Daily Function Among People With Parkinson Disease,Improvisational Dance for Parkinson Disease,,Interventional,Behavioral,Improvisational Dance Class,,Hour long movement classes that meet weekly for 12 weeks.,Not Applicable,2020-04-14,2020-04-20,2021-05-01,Unknown status,,,,"The long-term goal of this work is to maintain or improve daily function of people with PD by addressing cognition. The overall objective is to discover interventions that aid in cognitive functioning. The central hypothesis is that engagement in an improvisational dance (ID) class will benefit cognition among people with PD. Improvisational dance involves spontaneously generated movement, similar to how one moves in everyday life. The literature shows that ID classes positively impact motor impairments associated with PD, such as balance, gait, and functional mobility. Along with being physically demanding, ID requires the use and coordination of a number of cognitive capacities to properly execute movements. This type of activity challenges, and thus may strengthen, cognitive processes such as motor planning, decision making, flexible thinking, initiation, and execution, which may give people cognitive based strategies to be utilized in various aspects of daily life. By improving motor function and/or cognition, ID may also contribute to improved daily functioning, or the ability to perform and participate in daily activities. Despite these theoretical links, evidence for the effect of ID on cognition and overall daily function is limited. The current project objective is to address this gap and better understand the effects of ID for people with PD. Specifically, it will test the effect of IMPROVment®, a method of ID designed for people with PD, on cognition and daily function.||Participants' cognition will be assessed at baseline (T1) using the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery, the Alternate Uses Task, and the Weekly Calendar Planning Activity. Global cognition will be assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. They then will be randomly assigned to either the immediate intervention (ID) or waitlist-control (WC) group. The ID group will start the 12-week IMPROVment® intervention, which consists of weekly ID classes that progress according to a standardized method while the WC group will receive no intervention and continue with their regular daily routine and activity level. After 12 weeks, both groups will complete cognitive testing again (T2). Cognitive test scores will be compared across time points and between groups using a mixed model repeated measures ANOVA. The investigators hypothesize that IMPROVment® will have positive effects on the cognitive abilities of people with PD. Participants will also complete two questionnaires to assess daily function at T1 and T2: Older Americans Resources and Services Scale- Extended Version and PROMIS Satisfaction with Participation in Discretionary Social Activities. These scores will be compared similar to the above aim. The investigators hypothesize that IMPROVment® will have positive effects on daily function in people with PD.||Participant mood will be assessed in two different ways. The first being to investigate the immediate effect of participating in an IMPROVment® class on mood, fatigue, and anxiety. The investigators hypothesize that mood will positively improve from pre to post of each class. To assess this, participants will respond to a scale assessing mood, specifically sadness, nervousness, energy, and overall well-being before and after each class every week. The second measurement is to investigate the effect of IMPROVment® on anxiety, fatigue, and depression. The investigators hypothesize that IMPROVment® class will decrease feelings of depression for those with PD. All participants will fill out the Parkinson's Anxiety Scale, the Parkinson's Disease Fatigue Scale, and the Geriatric Depression Scale short form before and after participating in the 12-week IMPROVment® program.||Achievement of these aims will provide further support for the IMPROVment® method for people with PD experiencing cognitive deficits.

The Managing Fatigue Program, a six-week, self-management energy conservation course, focuses on strategies that help people with fatigue to make changes to save and use their energy to accomplish their daily activities. Several studies have adapted and evaluated different delivery formats of the program in conditions similar to Parkinson's disease, demonstrating that the Managing Fatigue Program is effective in reducing fatigue impact, depression, sleep problems, and improving quality of life, participation and self-efficacy. While this program has been tested in people living with many chronic conditions there has been only limited inclusion of people living with PD. This feasibility study, using a mixed-methods approach, nested in a pilot randomized control design, will evaluate the feasibility of the Individual Managing Fatigue Program from the perspectives of people with Parkinson's disease, and prepare for a full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT).||In this study, Managing Fatigue: The Individual Program (MFIP) will be delivered using videoconferencing.

The MFI is a self-report fatigue tool with 20 items measuring five dimensions: General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, Reduced Motion, and Reduced Activity. Elbers and colleagues (2012) evaluated the MFI in the PD population (N=153). After combining General Fatigue and Physical Fatigue dimensions they reported the reliability and validity of the four-domain scale (Physical Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, Reduced Motivation, and reduced activity) as higher than the original five-domain scale. Testing of the MFI shows good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.80) and construct validity compared to a Visual Analogue Scale measuring fatigue (0.22<r<0.78) (Smets et al., 1995).|Occupational balance will be measured with the Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ) (Wagman & Håkansson, 2014). The OBQ is an 11-item measure developed by Wagman et al., (2014), which assesses individuals' satisfaction and perception with the amount and variation of meaningful occupations. The OBQ measures satisfaction with the amount of time that one takes to accomplish tasks. It uses a 4-level ordinal response scale for each item ranging from 0 ""completely disagree"" to 3 ""completely agree"". The OBQ total score ranges from 0 (no occupational balance) to 35 (maximum occupational balance). The psychometric properties of the OBQ have not been explored in PD. However, in the general population, it has shown good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha= 0.936) and test, re-test reliability (Spearman's Rho= 0.926) for its total score (N=67). Neither ceiling nor floor effects were reported (Håkansson, Wagman, & Hagell, 2019).|Occupational performance will be measured with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) (Law, M. Baptiste, S., Carswell, A. McColl, M. A., Polatajko, H. & Pollock, 1998). The COPM was selected since it has proven to be sensitive to change and was able to detect significant differences between study groups at three months (mean difference =1.2 (95% CI 0.8-1.6) and after 6 months follow-up (mean differences= 0.9 ( 95%CI 0.5-1.3) (I. Sturkenboom et al., 2013). The COPM is a client-centred, standardized, cost-effective, occupation-focused measure used in occupational therapy. It is an individualized outcome measure administered using a semi-structured interview. It measures occupational performance and occupational satisfaction (Law, M. Baptiste, S., Carswell, A. McColl, M. A., Polatajko, H. & Pollock, 1998).|Quality of life will be measured with the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life-8 (PDQ-8) (Tan et al., 2004). The PDQ-8 is a short-form version of the Parkinson Disease Questionaire-39 which assesses the impact of PD on HRQoL over the past month. The PDQ-8 is a summary index with eight items, each representing one dimension of the PDQ-39 (Mobility, Activities of Daily Living, Emotional Well-being, Stigma, Social Support, Cognition, Communication, and Bodily Discomfort). It uses a 0-4 response scale. Scores are summed, then converted into a percentage. Lower scores indicate better quality of life (Peto et al., 1995). The PDQ-8 psychometric properties have been confirmed in several studies (Franchignoni, Giordano, & Ferriero, 2008; Katsarou et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2009; Tan, Luo, Nazri, Li, & Thumboo, 2004). Franchignon et al (2008) and Tan et al (2004) demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.72, 0.81) and construct validity between PDQ-8 and a measure of autonomy and|Sleep quality will be measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Buysse et al., 1989). PSQI is the most common assessment tool used to evaluate sleep quality (Mollayeva et al., 2016). It is a 19-item self-report assessment that measures seven components: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction (Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989). Component scores range from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty) and are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. A meta-analysis by Mollayeva et al. (2016) evaluated the measurement properties of the PSQI. This meta-analysis (N=37) demonstrated that the PSQI has good internal consistency based on Cronbach's alpha, strong reliability and validity, and moderate structural validity in a variety of samples. The PSQI has been used as an outcome measure to test the effectiveness|The Self-efficacy will be measured by the Self Efficacy for Performing Energy Conservation Strategies Assessment (SEPECSA) (Liepold & Mathiowetz, 2005). The SEPECSA was developed based on the Managing Fatigue Program (Liepold & Mathiowetz, 2005) and measures the individual's self-confidence to perform the strategies they learned in the program. The item response scale of the SEPECSA ranges from 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (completely confident). The final score is mean of the item scores. In a study of individuals with MS (N=36), Liepold & Mathiowetz (2005) demonstrated that the SEPECSA has high test and retest reliability (r = .776, ICC = .771), good validity, and very high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .953). The SPECSA has not been used with the PD population, however, it has been used in previous similar studies (Ghahari et al., 2010; Matuska, Mathiowetz, & Finlayson, 2007).","Changes from baseline fatigue impact to six weeks later at post-test, and after a three-month follow up.|Changes from baseline occupational balance to six weeks later, at post-test, and after a three-month follow up.|Changes from baseline occupational performance to six weeks later, at post-test, and after a three-month follow up.|Changes from baseline quality of life to six weeks later, at post-test, and after a three-month follow up.|Changes from baseline sleep quality to six weeks later, at post-test, and after a three-month follow up.|Changes from baseline self-efficacy to six weeks later, at post-test, and after a three-month follow up.",,,,"Relevance, acceptability, and usability of each session of the Individual Managing Fatigue Program|Relevance, acceptability, and usability of the Individual Managing Fatigue Program|Socio-Demographic Questionnaire.","The Feasibility Questionnaires 1, developed by the research team based on the purposes of the study and the program's intentions.

Many clinical biological or imaging biomarkers have been tested but no ""gold standard"" has been found as of yet. Among these, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) relaxometry using R2* measurement (R2* = 1/T2*), which is a validated marker for estimating brain iron concentration, appears to be an attractive technique because its safety, rapidly measured in clinical conditions and its ease to ensure individual longitudinal follow-up. Current data of cross sectional studies of R2*, which have shown an iron increase in Substantia Nigra (SN), led to suppose that it could be a biomarker of disease vulnerability. Recently, the investigators have conducted the first longitudinal follow-up of R2* (1.5 T MRI), which showed a rapid R2* increase in both parts of the SN and in the caudal putamen. We propose, here, a multicenter prospective study of one-year cohort follow-up of R2* variations (ΔR2*) in three regions of interest (ROIs) (the SN, the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and the Putamen) of 160 patients with PD, using a 3 Tesla MRI, to evaluate the potential interest of R2* as a biomarker of disease progression.

These exercises are to be done in different positions like lying down (recumbent) position, sitting and standing positions.

These exercises are done for three times everyday.",Not Applicable,2017-11-10,2021-02-17,2021-11-28,"Active, not recruiting",,,,"Abnormalities in the regulation of cardiovascular system due to autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction may lead to a sudden decline in blood pressure (BP) upon standing, sitting or performing activities/exercises in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This sudden decline in BP is known as 'orthostatic hypotension' (OH). OH may cause dizziness and/or black-outs, which may increase the risk of falls. As falls are potentially dangerous and disabling, it is important to prevent their occurrence. Keeping BP within normal range upon change of posture or with activities is therefore of great significance. Pooling of blood in the abdominal blood vessels may be one of the reasons for OH to happen. This research focuses on strengthening the weak abdominal muscles of the participants so that the compressive action of these muscles can help decrease such pooling. Therefore, the researchers hypothesize that strengthening the abdominal muscles shall prove to be helpful in controlling orthostatic hypotension by preventing a sudden decline in blood pressure of the participants upon assumption of upright posture. The secondary hypothesis is that there exists a significant difference in the response of the cardiovascular system to a variety of postures/activities/exercises when patients of PD having cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction are compared with patients of PD with normal ANS function.||This study has two parts - stage 1 and stage 2. Only stage 2 is a randomized controlled trial. Stage 1 involves testing the functional integrity of the autonomic nervous system, and observation of the cardiovascular responses of the participants to different postures/activities/exercises and to the use of an abdominal binder (which is a compressive garment worn around the abdomen). Findings of stage 1 shall help the researchers better understand the cardiovascular abnormalities present in such patients at rest and with activity. Stage 2 involves strength training for the abdominal muscles that is to be done by the participant at her/his residence for a period of 3 months followed by a second round of autonomic function testing and observation of the cardiovascular responses to the use of abdominal binder. Findings of stage 2 shall help the researchers determine if strength training of the abdominal muscles can be a useful strategy to counter the cardiovascular abnormalities found in the participants during the testing in stage 1.",No,No,,Blood Pressure,Continuous non-invasive monitoring using a finger cuff.

One of the most common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease is visual hallucinations (where someone sees things that don't exist outside their mind). . Recent findings led to the approval of a drug called Pimavanserin as a treatment for PD psychosis in the USA. Based on other recent studies, we believe that Saracatinib, a drug that interacts within the same system as Pimavanserin, is a potential treatment for PD psychosis. Saracatinib has shown to reduce the intensity of the psychedelic effect induced by psilocybin (a naturally occurring psychedelic found in psilocybe mushrooms) and attenuate social cognition and brain changes in healthy volunteers. The aim of this study is to test the effects of 14 days dosing of saracatinib or placebo on 30 volunteers with PD psychosis.

The frequency of symptoms is evaluated on a scale from 0 to 4. Two scoring systems are proposed to evaluate severity of symptoms (from 1-3): Severity score 1 refers to the impact of the symptoms on the patients' environment (ex: caregivers, family) as defined by the patients; Severity score 2 refers to the clinical severity as estimated by the clinician during the clinical interview. A composite score for each symptom is calculated: Frequency x Severity 1 (and Frequency x Severity 2). The composite scores of each symptom are then added to obtain the total score for the Category. The total score of the full scale is calculated by adding the total scores of Category A to E.

These gait problems are already apparent in the early disease stages, having an immense effect on daily life functioning. Especially Freezing of Gait (FOG), where the patients are not able to initiate or continue their movement despite their intention to do so, is a debilitating problem. It is thought that lack of gait adaptability could be an underlying cause of FOG. With a split-belt treadmill the speed of both legs can be controlled independently, which forces participants to actively adapt their gait to the new situation. In a previous study performed at our lab, it was shown that only one session of split-belt training (SBT), in which the speed of one leg was reduced, improved gait adaptability and other gait features compared to tied-belt training (TBT). Furthermore, overground turning speed improved after only one single training session and this was even retained 24 hours later, indicating training induced long-term potentiation.

The present study will address the transfer of treatment problem using two new treatment programs. Both treatments focus on improving speech intensity during conversations in different social contexts and a wide range of background noise conditions. The Speech-in-Noise (SIN) treatment program involves training higher speech intensity during variable levels of background noise while receiving real-time intensity feedback from a speech therapist. The second treatment, the Speech-to-Noise Feedback (SNF) device treatment program, involves using a wearable SNF device to provide feedback about an ideal target speech-to-noise level in a wide range of background noise conditions. Forty individuals with PD and their communication partners (i.e. spouse) will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment programs.

The cardinal motor impairments are tremor, bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, and postural instability. While dopaminergic medication and surgical treatment have been shown to suppress tremor, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity, they do not prevent the progression of the disease or effectively treat postural instability. The latter impairment, which often leads to frequent falls, substantially restricts motor performance and daily activities.||PD is commonly managed in outpatient neurology or movement disorder clinics. Clinical studies have shown that physical and balance rehabilitation regimens supervised by physical therapists can improve postural stability in people with PD for short (hours to days) and long (weeks to months) periods. Cost, limited availability of physical therapists, etc., however, often prohibit many people with PD from undertaking such regimens. Evidence is mounting that periodic and continuous exercising is important for people with PD who are under care at home. Nevertheless, when given a rehabilitation regimen to practice at home, compliance (i.e., adherence) and engagement generally decrease in the absence of real-time therapeutic feedback. The PI has developed a smartphone-based, wearable balance rehabilitation system, known as the Smarter Balance System (SBS), which supplies real-time feedback to people with PD practicing balance rehabilitation regimens at home.||The objectives of this study are to assess and compare the results of long-term rehabilitative balance training for people with PD performing in-home balance training regimens with assistive guidance via the SBS (intervention group) to people following a typical paper-based regimen (control group). The carry-over effects of long-term rehabilitative training by the intervention group and the control group on static/dynamic balance performance, daily activities, and confidence in less fear of falling are analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively.",No,No,,Range of limits of stability; change is being assessed|Sensory Organization Test (SOT) score; change is being assessed|Root mean square (RMS) of postural sway; change is being assessed|Elliptical area of postural sway; change is being assessed|Approximate entropy of postural sway; change is being assessed,"Limit of stability refers to the outermost range in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions at which the subject can lean from the vertical without changing the base of support.

Secondly, to determine whether adjustment of treatment of anti-dementia medication according to serum levels will benefit patients in terms of cognitive performance, quality of life, frequency and severity of side effects.||The reason for conduction of this study is that the relationship between serum-level of anti-dementia drugs, clinical efficacy, compliance and side effects has only been scarcely investigated.||Both a previously published study and a preliminary (pilot)study conducted imply that roughly 50 % of patients on donepezil have serum-levels outside the recommended interval.||Thus, MONANTI will investigate if this is indeed the case in a broadly comprised population of patients suffering from dementia treated with donepezil or memantine. In addition, MONANTI will link serum levels to co-morbidity, level of compliance, medication interactions. It is hypothesized that the efficacy of anti-dementia medication can be significantly improved by adjustment of treatment according to serum levels. Also, it is hypothesized that the burden of side effects can be reduced in patients in whom too high serum levels are detected, if dosage reduction or change of treatment drug is done.||MONANTI is a randomized study, in which the assessor is blinded to avoid related biases to the extent possible.||To fit the enrollment criteria a patient must be newly diagnosed with either Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy-bodies or Parkinson's disease with dementia and be described treatment with either donepezil or memantine. Also, the patient must not meet a list of (exclusion) criteria, which have been set up in order to avoid blur and biases of the results.||Patients can be selected as participators on account of the above, including an informed consent to participation. Next, the participators will randomized be assigned to one of two study arms. In the first of these, the control arm, the participators receive only standard treatment and follow-up at the outpatient clinic, except for measurement of serum level of the anti-dementia medication with which they are treated and a genetic test for a few key genes thought to be relevant for the study (two liver enzymes, two genes linked to Alzheimer's disease).||In the other arm, the intervention arm, the participators will be closely monitored for side effects after prescription of anti-dementia drugs. All these participators will be offered a measurement of serum level in case they experience possible side effects within 2 months of treatment initiation. If, not a measurement of the serum level will be done after 6 months. All patients in the intervention arm, will be offered adjustment of their treatment with the anti-dementia drug based upon serum level. To assess the possible effects of treatment adjustment seven clinical scoring tests will be used (MMSE, ACE, clock-drawing test, NPI-Q, DAD, GCI, GDS). Assessment includes symptom severity and level of compliance according to close relatives.||To measure the effect of donepezil on brain (cholinergic) function 30 participants will be recruited for electroencephalography (EEG).

The pathogenesis is a rapid antegrade conduction of atrial fibrillation over the accessory pathway to the ventricle resulting in ventricular fibrillation. Today it is possible to eliminate the conduction over the accessory pathway by catheter intervention (radiofrequency ablation) with a low rate of complications and a high rate of success. In clinical practice it is therefore important to estimate the risk for sudden cardiac death in an individual patient to give an advice to the patient and the parents about the further evaluation and therapeutic strategy. The velocity of the conduction over the accessory pathway can be estimated by analysing the ECG during sinus tachycardia. If the preexcitation disappears at a relatively low heart rate, the risk for sudden death is less than in patients with persisting preexcitation at the maximal heart rate. Compared to the gold standard i.e. measurement of the refractory period of the accessory pathway during invasive electrophysiological study (EPS), the measurements at the stress ECG have been reported to be a relatively poor indicator for an elevated risk which may be explained by a high intraindividual variability of this test. This study is designed to define the clinical relevance of the stress ECG in paediatric patients with preexcitation (compared to the invasive electrophysiological study).||First Hypothesis:||The results of the 3 stress ECG-tests are reproducible in an individual patient.||Null hypothesis: there is no difference between the three measurements of cycle length during stress ECG.

FFI is a rare genetic neurodegenerative disease characterized by disrupted sleep, autonomic hyperactivation and motor abnormalities with fatal exitus. FFI is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is linked to the D178N mutation in the prion protein gene (PRNP) in association with a methionine at the polymorphic codon 129 (D178N/M129). About thirty FFI pedigrees have been described worldwide, the mfirst case being reported in 1986 in northern Italy. This patient turned out to belong to large kindred, which spans 7 generations dating back to the eighteenth century. Many people belonging to this geneaology still live in the Veneto region of Italy, and they are part of an association. The genetic screening of 85 subjects belonging to this family permitted to identify the mutation carriers. Since the disease is aggressive and the affected people usually died within thirteen months from the onset, the possibility of an efficacious therapy when the disease become evident is unrealistic. This condition indicates in a preventive approach the better condition to affect the disease.

By focussing on improving motor neglect, outcomes including function and quality of life for these groups of patients may significantly improve.||Motor neglect is potentially reversible. Rehabilitation using repetition, feedback and motivation are beneficial for optimal outcome. Current protocols use face-to-face physical therapies which can not optimise intensity due to a lack of resources.

The patient's rate of progression on active therapy during the 36 week treatment arm will be compared to the rate of progression of the placebo arm. Disease progression in numerous ALS clinical trials has been measured using the ALSFRS-R which is a 12 question rating scale used to determine each participant's assessment of their capability and independence in daily activities. The ALSFRS-R can be administered with high inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability in person or over the phone. The advantages of using such a measurement to determine disease progression are that the categories are relevant to ALS, it is a sensitive and reliable tool, and the rate of decline correlates strongly with survival",During 36 weeks of therapy,"Measuring the levels of Tau, pNFH and the pNFH/C3 ratio in blood",Preliminary data have demonstrated that there are elevated levels of tau and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) in the blood of patients with ALS as compared to healthy controls suggesting that these proteins could also be used for measuring a patient's disease progression. Recently published data have also shown a high sensitivity and specificity for the ratio of pNFH/C3 in the CSF for diagnosing ALS. These combinations of biomarkers could be markers for axonal injury and neuronal cell death.,36 weeks of treatment,Slowing of behavioral decline in those with FTD characteristics based on the NPI-Q and the ALS-CBS,"It is demonstrated that up to half of patients with ALS may develop cognitive impairment during the course of the disease and up to 40% of ALS patients develop FTD. The ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS™) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), are two neuropsychological batteries that are validated, brief practical measures that will be administered. Previous data has shown that memantine can slow the progression of behavioral and cognitive decline in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lewy Body Disease, that there may be potential for a positive effect in patients with ALS. These scales should be great indicators of not only the diagnosis frototemporal dysfunction and even FTD, but also whether memantine can have any positive effect upon the progression of these changes.",the course of 36 weeks of treatment,"Inclusion Criteria:||Age 18-85|Male or Female|Clinically definite, probable, probable lab-supported, or possible ALS by El Escorial criteria|ALSFRS-R > 25|Must be willing to undergo longitudinal blood draws for biomarker analysis|Must have a caregiver|Availability and willingness to complete the study|Capable of providing informed consent and complying with trial procedures|If patients are taking riluzole and/or Radicava, they must be a on a stable dose for at least thirty days prior to the baseline.||Exclusion Criteria:||Patients with FVC ≤ 60%|History of liver disease|Severe renal failure|History of intolerance to memantine|Onset of weakness for greater than 3 years|Any other co-morbid condition which would make completion of the trial unlikely|If female, pregnant or breast-feeding; or, if of childbearing age, an unwillingness to use birth control.|Taking any trial medications.
